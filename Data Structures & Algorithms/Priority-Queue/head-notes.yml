Heap properties:
  - The root node always has the largest value.
  - Each node's descendants are smaller than the node itself (the parent is greater than its child).
  - It must be a complete tree.

Complete Tree:
  - A complete tree is a binary tree where all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
